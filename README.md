# Real Time Long-Term Evolution - Received Signal Strength Indicator Mapping Using Unsupervised Learning

An Android Application that graphically displays the signal strength heat
map using real time predictive machine learning algorithms


# Motivation

The mobile network user faces the issue of poor internet connectivity multiple times in a day, in a particular area, due to various reasons – most of which are due to external factors
such as physical obstruction, multiple reflections due to water bodies or tank chambers, weather at the given instant etc. But
more often than not, this network strength magnitude is not constant over an area; it is not even constant across the same
building. There are points in the building where there is an evident increase in network strength. If there were a tangible
way to deduce such geographical locations, and direct the user towards the same, much of today’s day to day network
related issues could be solved to a good extent, with ease.
